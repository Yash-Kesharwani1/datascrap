      "content": "Hello! Welcome to your Java technical interview. Let's start with some fundamental concepts. Can you explain the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Sure. JDK is the Java Development Kit which contains tools for developing Java applications. JRE is the Java Runtime Environment that provides libraries and JVM to run Java applications. JVM is the Java Virtual Machine that executes Java bytecode."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Excellent explanation! You've covered all three components clearly. Now, let's move to object-oriented programming. Can you explain what polymorphism is and provide a practical example of where you might use it?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Polymorphism means 'many forms'. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. For example, if I have a Shape parent class with a draw() method, I can have Circle and Rectangle subclasses that override draw() differently. I can then store different shapes in a List<Shape> and call draw() on each without knowing the specific type."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Perfect! That's a great real-world example. Let me ask you about exception handling now. What's the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions in Java? When would you use each?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be declared in a method signature or caught, like IOException or SQLException. Unchecked exceptions extend RuntimeException and don't need to be explicitly handled, like NullPointerException or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. I'd use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and unchecked for programming errors."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Great answer! You understand the distinction well. Let's discuss collections now. Can you explain when you would use a HashMap versus a TreeMap?"
