    "summary": "HashMap is not thread-safe, while ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe and optimized for concurrent access using internal locking mechanisms.",
    "detailed_answer": "HashMap allows null keys and values and is not synchronized, making it unsafe in multithreaded environments. ConcurrentHashMap uses finer-grained locking and does not allow null keys or values, offering better performance under concurrent access."
